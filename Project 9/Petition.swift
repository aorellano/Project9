import Foundation
struct Petition: Codable{
    var title: String
    var body: String
    var signatureCount: Int
}
//This defines a custom struct with three properties. One advantage of structs in Swift is that it gives us a meemberwise initializer
//- specialfunction that can create new Petition instances by passing in values for title, body, and signatureCount.
